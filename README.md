# RACK.js
Rackjs is a powerful web application designed specifically for kitchen professionals, providing them with a seamless way to manage their kitchen inventory.
Build with modern web technologies, Rackjs aims to bridge the gap in kitchen inventory management for kitchen professionals. It recognizes that kitchen professionals, such as chefs and restaurant owners, often face challenges in effectively managing their inventory. Traditional methods of inventory management, such as manual tracking or spreadsheets, can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient.
